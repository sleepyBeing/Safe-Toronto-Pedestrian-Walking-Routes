# StreetSmart

## Inspiration
  The GTA is an interesting and entertaining urban city of Ontario that attracts many people to explore its restaurants and attractions. I personally love to walk around Eaton centre, eating good food, shopping at famous clothing stores, and enjoying the busy atmosphere of people walking to work. However, the numerous crime incidents that have occured recently at Scarborough and the increasingly number of people roaming the streets of Toronto whilst under the influences of dangerous chemicals scares me. 

  StreetSmart ensures that the people of Toronto will feel as safe as possible while also providing a fast trip.
